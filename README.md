# odin-http
Prototype HTTP server/client work by Cloin &amp; Tetralux.

Originally developed as an addon to `core:net`.

It was dropped because to have a good `http` package in core, the scope would have had to include http auth, http/2, tls, web sockets, etc. None of us had any interest in this.

This code is provided as-is.
